> The description with storyboards from the proposal. 

Below is our storyboard. We designed our interaction with the idea of a globe that would have brushing and linking functionaliy to help explore world development data ([link](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712)). In particular, we would brush the globe which was located on the left and would link to multiple visualizations on the right hand side. The visualizations compare two groups (shown by two different colors in our storyboard) and would be enhanced by queries on the data (top box).

> A brief description of your final interactive visualization application.

The final interactive visualisation is a data exploration tool designed to better understand the world we live in. It allows us to select one or more countries and see the specific countries economic as well as development indicators. Along with this, it helps us compare the economic and development indicators of 2 countries with the help of a histogram and scatterplot. 

In particular, we were able to create a globe that was able to link to a histogram on the right hand side.

> An explanation of changes between the storyboard and the final implementation.

We were unable to implement box based selection, but efficiently implemented selection by clicking a country. We were unable to effectively scale the x axis in the histogram and scatterplot. And finally we were unable to make a radar plot for trivariate comparison

> A breakdown of how the work was split among the group members, including how much time did each person spend developing the application on which component?

Avery spent the most amount of time writing the back end of the code which included writing the code for the globe, cleaning the data, setting up the tsv file and the histogram. Sharada wrote the code for the scatterplot and helped with the slides. Oat helped in debugging and set up the graph axes and titles. Taha helped in writing the final write-up. Taha and Oat wrote the presentation slides, whereas we all helped in the initial proposal document.
